# Time-Series-Diagnostics
This code provides a series of diagnostic plots for time series analysis. These include ACF and PACF plots, predicted vs actual, residual plots, differenced residual plots, and many more.

## Here is the execution of the code:

time_series_diagnostic_main(index,actual,predicted, show_diagnostic_plots = True, show_performance_measures = True, show_ACF_PACF_plots = True, show_values = True)

## Here are is a description of the elements in the code. 

<b>'index'</b>     is the ordered index of values. This could be daily, monthly, annual values, or just an ordered set of values in series.
<b>'actual'</b>    are the the actual values in the series
<b>'predicted'</b> are the predicted values by the model

<b>'show_diagnostic_plots = True'</b>     displays the diagnostic plots
<b>'show_performance_measures = True'</b> displays the model performance statistics
<b>'show_ACF_PACF_plots = True'</b>       displays the ACF and PACF plots
<b>'show_values = True'</b>               displays the actual, predicted, and residual values
